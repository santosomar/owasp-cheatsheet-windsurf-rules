  Ensure your application uses modern, strong TLS protocols and cipher suites,
  manages certificates securely, enforces HTTPS site-wide, and protects sensitive data in transit.
  This prevents common TLS vulnerabilities and enhances communication security.

  Follow these critical TLS security best practices:
  - Use TLS 1.3 by default; fallback to 1.2 only if necessary, disable older protocols and SSL.
  - Configure strong cipher suites (AEAD GCM), secure DH groups, and disable TLS compression.
  - Securely manage certificates: use SHA-256+, correct FQDN in CN/SAN, avoid wildcard certs unless scoped.
  - Enforce HTTPS site-wide with 301 redirects and HSTS (including preload and subdomains).
  - Load all page resources securely to prevent mixed content issues.
  - Set Secure flag on cookies to restrict to HTTPS.
  - Prevent caching of sensitive data via HTTP headers.
  - Avoid public key pinning in browsers.
  - Regularly test TLS settings using recommended online and offline tools.
  Keeping TLS configurations up to date and secure protects user data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

fix: |
  - Update your TLS configuration files/code to enable TLS 1.3 and disable TLS 1.0/1.1 and SSL v2/v3.
  - Restrict cipher suites to AEAD GCM modes; disable weak and anonymous ciphers.
  - Use strong DH groups and favored ECDHE curves.
  - Disable TLS compression features.
  - Ensure private keys are at least 2048-bit and file permissions restrict access.
  - Obtain certificates with SHA-256+ hashing and correct domain names.
  - Use HTTPS for all pages; configure 301 HTTPâ†’HTTPS redirects and HSTS with preload.
  - Review and correct all page resources and script includes to load over HTTPS only.
  - Mark all cookies Secure and set cache-control headers to prevent sensitive data caching.
  - Remove HPKP headers in public web apps; consider pinning only in closed environments.
  - Integrate TLS configuration testing tools into your CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions early.
