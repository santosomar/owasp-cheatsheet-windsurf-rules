As a software engineer implementing authentication systems, you should be aware that security questions are no longer considered a strong authentication factor. Modern best practices strongly recommend against using them as a standalone method for authentication or account recovery.

### Preferred Alternatives to Security Questions

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement time-based one-time passwords (TOTP), push notifications, or hardware security keys as your primary account recovery mechanism.
*   **One-Time Recovery Codes:** Generate and provide users with a set of single-use recovery codes when they set up their account.
*   **Email-Based Recovery:** Send a time-limited, single-use recovery link to a verified email address.

### If You Must Use Security Questions (Legacy Systems)

If your organization requires security questions for legacy or compliance reasons, implement these critical safeguards:

#### 1. Question Selection

*   **Provide a Curated List:** Offer a predefined set of strong questions rather than allowing free-form user-created ones.
*   **Question Quality:** Choose questions that are:
    *   **Memorable:** Users can consistently recall the answer over time.
    *   **Stable:** The answer doesn't change over the user's lifetime.
    *   **Confidential:** Not easily discoverable through social media or public records.
    *   **Specific:** Has a single, precise answer rather than multiple possible answers.

#### 2. Answer Handling

*   **Secure Storage:** Hash all answers using a strong password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.
*   **Normalization:** Before comparing answers, normalize them by removing extra spaces, converting to lowercase, and removing punctuation.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Enforce a minimum length but allow legitimate short answers.
    *   Implement a denylist for weak answers like "password", "123456", or the user's own username/email.

#### 3. Implementation Best Practices

*   **Multi-Layered Security:** Use multiple questions together for increased security.
*   **Consistent Question:** When a user fails to answer correctly, don't rotate to a different questionâ€”this helps prevent attackers from learning all the answers through multiple attempts.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Treat incorrect answers as authentication failures and apply the same lockout policies you would for password attempts.
*   **Verify Email First:** Always verify ownership of the recovery email address before presenting security questions.
*   **Require Authentication:** Require re-authentication (password or MFA) before allowing users to change their security questions or answers.

By following these guidelines, you can minimize the risks associated with security questions while working toward implementing more secure authentication methods.
