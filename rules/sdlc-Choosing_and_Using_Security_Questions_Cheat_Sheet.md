rule: Avoid_Using_Insecure_Security_Questions
name: Avoid Using Security Questions as Sole Authentication or Recovery Factor
message: |
  Security questions are no longer considered a strong authentication factor and should never stand alone for authentication or account recovery.

  Follow these best practices:
  1. Avoid relying solely on security questions for login or recovery; always use strong authentication like MFA.
  2. If security questions are needed for legacy reasons:
     - Choose questions that are memorable, consistent, confidential, applicable, and specific.
     - Provide a limited, strong predefined list of questions rather than free-form user-created ones.
     - Avoid common or easily discovered questions (e.g., birthdate, nickname).
  3. Validate and restrict answers:
     - Enforce minimum length but allow legitimate short answers.
     - Denylist weak or easily guessable answers like username, email, "123", or "password".
  4. Hash all answers securely using a password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) and normalize when comparing.
  5. Secure recovery flows:
     - Verify recovery email ownership before presenting questions.
     - Treat incorrect answers as failed attempts; apply lockouts.
  6. Require re-authentication (password or MFA) before allowing changes to security questions/answers.
  7. Use multiple questions to increase security but do not rotate questions on failureâ€”lock to one question to prevent guessing.
  8. Periodically prompt users to review and update their answers (e.g., during password changes).

  Summary: Phase out security questions or replace them with stronger methods like MFA. If used, apply these controls rigorously to mitigate risks.
