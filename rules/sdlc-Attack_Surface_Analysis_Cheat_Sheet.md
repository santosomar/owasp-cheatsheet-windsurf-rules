Keep an up-to-date map of your application's attack surface:
identify and categorize all entry/exit points (APIs, UIs, files, databases, messages),
prioritize security reviews on externally facing and high-risk components,
and continuously reassess as your app evolves. Remove unused features/interfaces,
and complement secure coding with operational controls like WAFs and firewalls.
Use threat modeling and tools regularly to measure and manage your attack surface effectively.
